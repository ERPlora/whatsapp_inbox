// A screen the QA robot cannot name is a screen nobody tests (whatsapp_inbox#153, out of hub#1756).
//
// The hub's QA drives the screens with Playwright, and Playwright addresses by `data-testid`: it
// is the only hook that survives a copy change, the `en`↔`es` translation (ADR-0055/0199) and the
// Shadow DOM of a Web Component. When a control has none, the spec falls back to a selector by
// text or by `nth` — and both break on their own: the text changes with the language and the
// position changes the moment somebody adds a field. That is how the restaurant QA walk of
// 2026-09-09 left two points of this module unverified.
//
// This is the guard of the PATTERN, not a patch over one screen. The hub's twin lives in
// `apps/web/src/form-testids.test.ts`; the convention both obey is written once, in
// `architecture/hub/apps/testids.md`: `<surface>-<field|action|state>`, kebab-case, and the rows
// of a list carry their identity at the end (`whatsapp-settings-activate-${family}`), never the index.
//
// Two things are NOT copied from the hub's guard, because this repo is not Vue:
//
//   · The surfaces are Lit components (`html` tagged templates inside `.ts`), so there is no
//     `<template>` block to cut: the whole source is the template, and a computed hook is written
//     `data-testid=${...}`, not `:data-testid="..."`.
//   · The hub only reads LITERAL hooks, so renaming a COMPUTED one stays green there and breaks
//     the specs days later, in another repo (hub#1828). Here a computed hook is read too: its
//     static head must live under the surface's prefix and end in `-`, so renaming it breaks HERE.
//
// Four rules, because they stop four different things:
//
//   · COVERAGE — in a registered surface no control, no action and no state banner is left
//     without a hook. It is what makes the field somebody adds next month born addressable.
//   · CONTRACT — the names the QA writes in its specs are declared here, and the declared set is
//     EXACTLY the one in the file. Renaming a hook has to break THIS test first, here, where it
//     is seen.
//   · TABLE — every `<ok-data-table>` declares its `testid` namespace. Three of the four surfaces
//     here ARE a table: without that one attribute the «+», the searchbar, every row, every row
//     action and the pager paint NO hook at all (outfitkit#143), and the CRUD stays undrivable
//     however well the side form is hooked up.
//   · RATCHET — every surface with something addressable is classified: covered, or pending with
//     its issue. A new component cannot slip in unclassified, and the pending list only shrinks.
