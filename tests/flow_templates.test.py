"""The flow templates in `flows/` have to be REAL: valid documents, exact grants, no typos (pm#112).

A flow template is the one artefact in this repo that nothing else checks. It is not compiled, it
is not packed into the module zip (see `flows/README.md`) and the runtime only sees it the day
somebody pastes it into `PUT /api/hub/flows`. So the ways it can be wrong are all silent, and all
of them surface at 3 AM in front of a customer:

1. **The document does not parse** → `PUT /api/hub/flows` refuses it and the salon has no
   automation. Checked against `hub/schemas/flow.schema.json`, the contract the hub itself serves.
2. **The grants do not match the document** → the flow saves, arms its trigger, runs, and dies on
   the first step that needed a grant nobody wrote down (`flow.grant_denied`). Every `ai` tool
   needs its `query`/`command` grant; every `notify` step needs BOTH a `notify` grant for its
   channel and a `recipient_query` grant for its exact `<query>#<field>` pair — they are two
   separate questions on purpose (hub#821). The check runs both ways: a grant that no step uses is
   an authorisation the owner was asked for and nobody spends.
3. **A query or command does not exist** → same silence, one layer down. Checked against the real
   manifests of the workspace when it is there.
4. **The translations drift.** `*.en.flow.json` is the source and `*.es.flow.json` is what ships
   with the Spanish blueprint. If they stop being the same automation — a tool added to one, a step
   renamed in the other — then «the Spanish one» quietly became a different product. Only the human
   text may differ.
